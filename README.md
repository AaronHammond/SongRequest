SongRequest
===========
This was hacked together over a weekend in August 2012 to keep my Spring/ExtJS skills sharp. It features a cutesy JS frontend with API hooks into Spotify to allow collaborative creation of playlists that can easily be exported. It was originally hosted on AWS (another learning opportunity!) through Elastic Beanstalk. With Spring Roo scaffold generation, the server side code was cake, and most of the work centered around imploring ExtJS to look reasonably pleasant on IE.
